## Introduction

Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects a person's movement. This repository contains a tool for detecting Parkinson's Disease through speech analysis. The tool uses machine learning techniques to analyze speech recordings and determine the likelihood of the presence of Parkinson's Disease.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ParkinsonDetection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```shell
   cd ParkinsonDetection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies.
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your speech recordings in the `data` directory.

2. Run the detection script.
   ```shell
   python detect_parkinson.py --audio_path data/sample_audio.wav
   ```

3. The script will output the likelihood of Parkinson's Disease presence based on the provided speech recording.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the [Parkinson's Disease Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nidaguler/parkinsons-data-set), which contains speech recordings from individuals with and without Parkinson's Disease. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features from the audio recordings.

## Methodology

The detection model is built using machine learning techniques, employing features extracted from speech recordings as inputs. A classification algorithm, such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machine, is trained on these features to differentiate between individuals with and without Parkinson's Disease.

## Results

The performance of the Parkinson's Disease detection model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model's effectiveness in identifying Parkinson's Disease from speech recordings is presented in the project's documentation.
